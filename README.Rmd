The goal of butterfly is to aid in the quality assurance of continually updating and overwritten time-series data, where we expect new values over time, but want to ensure previous data remains unchanged. 

```{r butterfly_diagram, echo=FALSE, out.width="100%", fig.cap=""}
knitr::include_graphics("man/figures/README-butterfly_diagram.png")
```


Data previously recorded could change for a number of reasons, such as discovery of an error in model code, a change in methodology or instrument recalibration. Monitoring data sources for these changes is not always possible.

Unnoticed changes in previous data could have unintended consequences, such as invalidating DOIs, or altering future predictions if used as input in forecasting models.

This package provides functionality that can be used as part of a data pipeline, to check and flag changes to previous data to prevent changes going unnoticed.

## Installation

You can install the development version of butterfly from [GitHub](https://github.com/) with:

``` r
# install.packages("devtools")
devtools::install_github("thomaszwagerman/butterfly")
```

## Overview
The butterfly package contains the following:

  * `butterfly::loupe()` - examines in detail whether previous values have changed, and reports them using `waldo::compare()`.
  * `butterfly::catch()` - returns rows which contain previously changed values in a dataframe.
  * `butterfly::release()` - drops rows which contain previously changed values, and returns a dataframe containing new and unchanged rows.
  * `butterflycount` - a list of monthly dataframes, which contain fictional butterfly counts for a given date.

## Examples

This is a basic example which shows you how to use butterfly:

```{r simple_example}
library(butterfly)

# Imagine a continually updated dataset that starts in January and is updated once a month
butterflycount$january

# In February an additional row appears, all previous data remains the same
butterflycount$february

# In March an additional row appears again
# ...but a previous value has unexpectedly changed
butterflycount$march
```

We can use `butterfly::loupe()` to examine in detail whether previous values have changed.

```{r butterfly_example}
butterfly::loupe(
  butterflycount$february,
  butterflycount$january,
  datetime_variable = "time"
)

butterfly::loupe(
  butterflycount$march,
  butterflycount$february,
  datetime_variable = "time"
)
```

`butterfly::loupe()` uses `dplyr::semi_join()` to match the new and old objects using a common unique identifier, which in a timeseries will be the timestep. `waldo::compare()` is then used to compare these and provide a detailed report of the differences.

`butterfly` follows the `waldo` philosophy of erring on the side of providing too much information, rather than too little. It will give a detailed feedback message on the status between two objects.

### Using butterfly for data wrangling
You might want to return changed rows as a dataframe, or drop them altogether. For this `butterfly::catch()` and `butterfly::release()` are provided.

Here, `butterfly::catch()` only returns rows which have **changed** from the previous version. It will not return new rows.

```{r butterfly_catch}
df_caught <- butterfly::catch(
  butterflycount$march,
  butterflycount$february,
  datetime_variable = "time"
)

df_caught
```

Conversely, `butterfly::release()` drops all rows which had changed from the previous version. Note it retains new rows, as these were expected.

```{r butterfly_release}
df_released <- butterfly::release(
  butterflycount$march,
  butterflycount$february,
  datetime_variable = "time"
)

df_released
```

## Relevant packages and functions
The butterfly package was created for a specific use case of handling continuously updating/overwritten time-series data, where previous values may change without notice. 

There are other R packages and functions which handle object comparison, which may suit your specific needs better:

* [waldo](https://github.com/r-lib/waldo)
* [diffdf](https://github.com/gowerc/diffdf)
* [assertr](https://github.com/tonyfischetti/assertr)
* [daquiri](https://github.com/ropensci/daiquiri/)

Other functions include `all.equal()` or [dplyr](https://github.com/tidyverse/dplyr)'s `setdiff()`
